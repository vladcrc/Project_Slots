# Slot Machine Simulation Project

## Introduction
My project simulates a slot machine game using a hardware platform. This game is a replica of a slot machine.

### What the project does
The project allows users to experience the basic mechanics of a slot game. By pressing a button, an animation symbolizing the run is triggered, and the result is displayed by a combination of emojis.

### The purpose of the project
The project is educational. Also, the goal is to provide an engaging experience to the user while learning about the logic of gambling.

### The idea from which I started
I proposed to combine entertainment with education, using a well-known concept - slot machine. The idea was inspired by the popularity of gambling, but with an emphasis on simplicity and safety, without financial implications.

### Why it's useful
It is useful because it can help gambling addicts to play without financial implications.

###4.![Components Used and Their Roles:]

Arduino Uno:
The main microcontroller that controls all components.

8x8 LED Matrix with MAX7219:
Used to display the game state.

16x2 LCD (without I2C):

Displays game information (e.g., score, status).
Connected via digital pins 

Joystick:

Controls movements and selections in the game.

Passive Buzzer:

Generates sounds based on game actions.

Potentiometers:

LCD Contrast Adjustment: Central pin â†’ VO pin on the LCD.

Here is the energy consumption section formatted for GitHub in Markdown:

###6.![Power Consumption]
Arduino Uno:
Operates at 5V and can directly power the connected components.

8x8 LED Matrix (MAX7219):
The MAX7219 manages the current for the LEDs with a maximum of 40 mA per segment.

Buzzer and LCD:
Both have a low power consumption, approximately 20-30 mA each.
